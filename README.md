# WhiskerWoof

Hey There ðŸ‘‹. This here's an implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with PyTorch for classifying images of cats and dogs. You can download the dataset at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765

## Before you start

In your project root directory, make sure to create a 'data' folder, and each image class to have a subfolder inside it.

The `main.py` file contins code for testing my pre-trained WhiskerWoof model. Feel free to tinker around and train further

> Note: Some images in the dataset are truncated and/or empty and may have to be deleted. I'd rather you execute a python script than delete manually

## You'll Need

- Python 3.8 or higher
- torch
- matplotlib
- torchvision
- scikit-learn
- Pillow

### Additional required packages can be found in the requirements.txt
